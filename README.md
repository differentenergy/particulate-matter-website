# Particulate Matter Education Website

An interactive, bilingual (English/中文) educational website about particulate matter and air quality, focusing on particles smaller than PM2.5.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Particle Slider**: Drag through different particle sizes (PM10 → Ultrafine) to see how smaller particles penetrate deeper into the human body
- **Bilingual Support**: Seamlessly switch between English and Chinese
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for smartphones and tablets
- **Science-Based**: Educational content grounded in research about sub-PM2.5 particles
- **Beautiful Animations**: Smooth particle effects and micro-interactions

## 🎯 Purpose

This website challenges the common belief that "big pollution = big danger" by teaching that smaller particles actually cause deeper biological penetration and greater systemic harm. It's designed to:

- Rewire mental models about air quality
- Educate about particles below PM2.5 that regulations often ignore
- Present scientific evidence in an accessible, visual format

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 💻 Technology

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- Canvas API for particle animations
- Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions

## 📱 Mobile Support

Fully tested and optimized for:
- iOS Safari
- Android Chrome
- Touch gestures and interactions

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Following a "vibe-coding" approach that prioritizes:
- Cognitive impact over decoration
- Visual learning over text density
- Scientific credibility over marketing claims
- Experiential interaction over static information
